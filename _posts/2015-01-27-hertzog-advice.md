title: 'Life Advice from Werner Hertzog'
---

Lately, I've realized that if I have certain blog post open as a tab for a long time so that I 
continuously revisit it, I should probably write it down. Kottke.org's recent piece
about Werner Herzog's life advice is one of these posts.

The original piece is at http://kottke.org/15/01/24-pieces-of-life-advice-from-werner-herzog and definitely
merits a read. But, the list itself is as follows:

1. Always take the initiative.
2. There is nothing wrong with spending a night in jail if it means getting the shot you need.
3. Send out all your dogs and one might return with prey.
4. Never wallow in your troubles; despair must be kept private and brief.
5. Learn to live with your mistakes.
6. Expand your knowledge and understanding of music and literature, old and modern.
7. That roll of unexposed celluloid you have in your hand might be the last in existence, so do something impressive with it.
8. There is never an excuse not to finish a film.
9. Carry bolt cutters everywhere.
10. Thwart institutional cowardice.
11. Ask for forgiveness, not permission.
12. Take your fate into your own hands.
13. Learn to read the inner essence of a landscape.
14. Ignite the fire within and explore unknown territory.
15. Walk straight ahead, never detour.
16. Manoeuvre and mislead, but always deliver.
17. Don't be fearful of rejection.
18. Develop your own voice.
19. Day one is the point of no return.
20. A badge of honor is to fail a film theory class.
21. Chance is the lifeblood of cinema.
22. Guerrilla tactics are best.
23. Take revenge if need be.
24. Get used to the bear behind you.

As much as I dislike the reblog link trafficking that happens all over the internet, I'll betray my own values
for this piece.
