<h2 id="i_am_imperfect">I am imperfect</h2>

<p>I have many flaws, character and otherwise. Some are more critical to fix than others. But, here’s a list of things I need to step up my game on:</p>

<ul>
<li>I wish I were more patient.</li>

<li>I wish I were better at finishing projects.</li>

<li>I wish I took learning more seriously.</li>

<li>I wish I were more active in my community.</li>

<li>I wish I were better at forgiveness. Including forgiving myself.</li>

<li>I wish I were a better parter.</li>
</ul>

<p>But, simply “wishing” does nothing. It’s bullshit.</p>

<p>I won’t be wishing anymore. I guess I’ll be working.</p>
