title: Things I wish I was better at
---

## I am imperfect

I have many flaws, character and otherwise. Some are more critical to fix than others.
But, here's a list of things I need to step up my game on:

- I wish I were more patient.
- I wish I were better at finishing projects.
- I wish I took learning more seriously.
- I wish I were more active in my community.
- I wish I were better at forgiveness. Including forgiving myself.
- I wish I were a better parter.

But, simply "wishing" does nothing. It's bullshit.

I won't be wishing anymore. I guess I'll be working.
