title: 'Experimenting with Lettering'
---

Like most people I know, I try to learn new things on a regular basis. Recently, I've been studying design principles
and digital illustration. I've been passionate about great usability for a long time, but I've never taken the time
to study the visual side of design until the past few months.

Over the past week, I've rewatched Jessica Hische's 
[Passion Projects talk on side projects and "procrastiworking"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZbqJxQJ5LY)
and it finally dawned on me: I should finally carve out some time to actually _make_ something with all of the
design I've been absorbing. Also, since I was already watching Jessica's work over the week, focusing on lettering 
seemed fun.

I decided to put a line-based lettering twist on the Fastly brand. I wasn't using the Fastly design assets as reference,
but I wanted to make something that refected us as a company, even if it was in a way that only internal Fastly folks
would understand.

To give some backstory, many of our core internal systems are named with the phrase `FST` in the convention.
Some of these are `FST-stats`, `FST-loader`, `ZD-FST`; we're a creative bunch when it comes to system names. So,
it seemed fitting to focus on this phrase: FST. It's something meaningful to us, and it's not too overwhelming for
a quick project. I only have Pixelmator on my machine too, so the actual work took significantly longer than if I 
were using something like InDesign, or another first class publishing too.

It's pretty rough, and I had to hand-build the vectors on the "S" and it shows, but here it is:
