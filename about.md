## Why hello there! I didn't see you.

I'm Austin. I live in San Francisco, and I've become one of those people who likes growing startups. I used to live in Oklahoma City,
where I worked with a bunch of small business in the technology space. I spent some time as a
[GitHubber](https://github.com/blog/1191-austin-spires-is-a-githubber) on their sales and support groups. I'm now at
[Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/about/team), the most [legit CDN in the game](http://vimeo.com/14782834), building out the support and SE
teams.

You can find me as either ASpires or AustinSpires on most of the things. I [tweet](https://twitter.com/austinspires) bad jokes, write bad
[code](http://github.com/aspires) whenever I can, and spend way too much time cooking and "artisinally exploring" beer. You can email me at austinspires@gmail.com.
